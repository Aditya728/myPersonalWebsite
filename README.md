# myPersonalWebsite

### This repository contains code for my personal website. I have explored concepts like Glassmorphishm and advanced CSS to make the website look very elegant and beautiful. I have worked on building 9 areas: `navigation bar, skills, recent works, projects, contact, introduction blogs, startup video, chatbot coding and deployment, and footer.` All designs are self-created by me and 100% effort has gone to writing the 5000+ lines of code.

#### Visit [aditya.com.np](https://www.adityakarki.com.np/) to see the deployment.
