# myPersonalWebsite
This repository contains code for my personal website. I have explored concepts like `Glassmorphishm and advanced CSS` to make the website look very elegant and beautiful. I have worked on building 7 areas: **navigation bar, my introduction, skills, recent works, projects, contact, and footer.** All designs are self-created by me and 100% effort has been gone to writing the 5000+ lines code.
