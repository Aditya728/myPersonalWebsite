# myPersonalWebsite
This repository contains code for my personal website. I have explored concepts like Glassmorphishm and advanced CSS to make the website look very elegant and beautiful. I have worked on building 7 areas: navigation bar, my introduction, skills, recent works, projects, contact, and footer. All designs are self-created by me and 100% effort has been gone to writing the 1000+ line code.
